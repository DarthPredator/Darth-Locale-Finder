# Darth's Locale Finder
A tool for ElvUI that helps in identifying missing or untranslated lines in locale files

# Usage
Go to plugin's config section and press "Get Locales" button.
That will populate all the sections with the current version of locales from both core ElvUI and every plugin currently running

"Missing" tab will give you the rundown of all the lines missing from locales split into separate tabs for each locale.

"Locales" tab has all the lines split alphabetically just so you can see and compare stuff.
